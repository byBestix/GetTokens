A script designed to get the tokens for the AVQL reached script from https://xdaforums.com/t/how-to-unlock-bootloader-on-xiaomi-hyperos-all-devices-except-cn.4654009/

Before running, download the AVQL script from https://xdaforums.com/t/how-to-unlock-bootloader-on-xiaomi-hyperos-all-devices-except-cn.4654009/.

This script needs to be extracted to where the script.py of AVQL is.

This script will ask the user to login on firefox, then login on chrome. After that, it will create a token.txt file and start 4 windows of the script.py file in the avql folder to ask for permission to unlock.
